This is Paul's version of Ed & Eric's FW that drives tankbot & runs on
the VIA board under linux. It's what was used at All-Con 2009 to roll
tankbot slowly back & forth.

How to make the robot 'work'.

You need to test that we can talk to the robto
./estop
(It should report that "the robot is talking".)
If it reports that the robot is not talking, rerun it - the robot
should now talk. If it doesn't, power cycle.

Build the application by typing "make"

Run the application with a command like:
./Live
