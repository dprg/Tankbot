Misc Tankbot Notes
==================

Idea: Timestamp response to query so you can correlate data from different processors
Alternate idea: query fast as possible from sensor, and return cached value to the main processor on demand, 
and timestamp on the main processor using average latency

Basic current draw, router + uC + LEDs (PC off): 350mA
Started PC, current went to 3.2A. (Note: voltage drop was too high to allow PC to boot - it 
may consume more in operation) i.e. PC draws 2.85A quiescent

Ed discussion 12/9/08
- Look at Player/Stage (robotics simulator)
- Look at active vision video - they have a link to instructions on how to use ptam

Steve Rainwater got the perspex from E&D plastics downtown - they have lots of droppings - say I'm from DPRG, they might sell by the pound or give away. Note: Lexan from Elliots is equivalent.
