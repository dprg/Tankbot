How to do stuff in Puppy
========================

Starting puppy Linux' desktop
-----------------------------
- If Puppy boots up to the prompt & stops, type xwin to start xwindows. This typically happens when you restart after a hard poweroff. In this condition, tankbot is not on the network so you can't VNC to it. Recovery via a hard-wired keybd is necessary.
- If you need to setup video (Ignore doesn't start xwindows) type xorgwizard and run the video setup wizard. You can set screen resolution to 1024x768, or anything else that will work.

If your mouse doesn't work
--------------------------
Alt-F1 brings up the start menu. You can use the arrow keys to move around the start menu, Enter to select an entry. Arrows to move around the fields in a dialog box.

How to find out tankbot's IP:
-----------------------------
- Log into the club router at 192.168.1.1 (passwd is blank)
- Select the DHCP clients link, and look for a client called puppypc. The IP address is shown next to it
- If you have keybd & mouse, you can start an x-window and run ifconfig, to print the current IP address(es).

Connecting to Tankbot using VNC
-------------------------------
- Once the desktop is displayed by the onboard monitor, vnc to Tankbot's IP, and use the vnc passwd "tankbot", and you'll be connected to Tankbot's desktop.
- Puppy linux starts VNC automatically (as a service). However, as noted above, the boot can hang if it expects a mouse & doesn't find one. This can happen if you were using keybd/mouse & then disconnected them. In this case, you'll see a prompt on the onboard monitor, but no desktop. The only way out I know is to connect monitor & keybd & tell it there is a serial mouse on com2.

How to attach to a network if Tankbot doesn't automatically attach:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- Attach a keybd, monitor & mouse
- Click the "connect" icon on the desktop & follow the obvious steps to configure internet by network or wireless LAN.

How to install new software
---------------------------
- Unfortunately, puppy linux uses it's own format for install packages (a .pet package), so there is a more limited selection of packages that for more major distributions.
- There's a limited selection of packages available from the puppy package manager (available through menu -> setup.
- The best source of software that's not available through the puppy package manager is http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy - browse the forum for the package you want
- Google can be your best friend
- Once you find the package you want, open up the URL in Puppy's browser (called seabiscuit - it's really a version of the Mozilla browser). The browser will ask you if you want to run the puppy package manager to deal with that file type - say yes and it will install.


Transferring files
------------------
There are 3 ways to transfer files between a PC and Tankbot:
1) Shared Folder: the /root/my-documents/tankbot directory is exported as a windows shared folder (no password). Just navigate with Windows Explorer to \\<tankbot_ip>\tankbot and you'll see the files. This is the current working directory. You can use a PC-based IDE tool to edit, and run make on tankbot, if you want.
2) ftp: the /root/ftpd directory is available by ftp (user root, passwd tankbot). Just get an ftp program such as WinSCP and send it to tankbot_ip and you will be able to copy files back & forth.
3) Shut puppy down, remove the thumb drive from the USB hub, plug it into the PC, copy files onto it, & re-install it in Tankbot

Using Subversion to access the repository
-----------------------------------------
Subversion is installed on Tankbot. The following commands are useful:
- svn checkout http://svn.dprg.org/svn/repos/tankbot/trunk
... work, work, work
- svn update
- svn add <filename> (if needed)
- svn commit

How to use serial communications to talk to AVR or Arduino boards
-----------------------------------------------------------------
# minicom ttyS0 
contacts the AVR board. ^AE turns echo on (desirable). Issue the command XXX and the AVR board should respond with COK. See the AVR text doc for other commands.
# minicom ttyUSB0 
connects to the Arduino board.
- Typically, you want to do ^Ae to enable local echo, so you can see what you type
- Minicom has a poor UI. Hit ^Az to get help. If you think the comm parameters are screwed up (say, the port is wrong), you need to do ^Ao and set the port and other parameters, save it in a profile, THEN EXIT MINICOM & RESTART IT WITH THE SAVED PROFILE NAME. Look to see it says /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyUSB0 when you start minicom, otherwise it will act like its talking, but will not be. The correct parameters for both AVR (ttyS0) and Arduino (ttyUSB0) are 9600/8/N/1.

Puppy Linux Install Notes
-------------------------
- Install per HDD installation procedure on puppy linux wiki. Note: must select media to install to as "Internal (IDE or SATA) hard drive", not
"Internal IDE/Sata Flash drive (CF card in IDE adapter", otherwise you don't get the full-install option. Go through & install grup per procedure.
You end up with df showing ~36% use on /dev/sda2.
- Install X11vnc server from www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.phb?t=27424. Do it by sending the puppy browser to that URL, clicking
the download link & telling the browser to run pupget on the application. Install x11vnc as a service. This will put an
initialization script in the Startup directory of /root, which kicks off x11vnc on graphical startup.
- Install the devx package, which brings g++, make, libc, and the rest of the development tools. Google for puppy linux devx, and find the latest
download, and download the version corresponding to the puppy linux installed version. Tankbot has 4.11 installed, so I downloaded devx 4.11.sfs
and saved it away. Then follow instructions at www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.phb?t=22701 to install the devx package. After removing the sfs
file, disk will be 78% full.
- Install the openssh client & server. Search www.murga-linux.com/puppy for openssh to find the .pet files
- edit /boot/grub/menu.lst & change 
#timeout 30 
to 
timeout 5

USB camera installation
--------------------
- Install the luvcview (available from the murga-linux forum. luvcview will require also installing sdl-1.2 (multimedia library), also available from the murga-linux forum.
- reboot
- run it with lucview -f yuv
