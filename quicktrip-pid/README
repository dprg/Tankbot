This is an earlier version of Ed & Eric's tankbot FW that runs under linux
on the VIA board. It was when Ed added PID capability.

How to make the robot 'work'.

First you need to set up the serial settings
ctty -F /dev/ttyS0 < /root/set3.txt

Second you need to test that we can talk to the robto
/root/tankbot-v3/estop
(It should report that "the robot is talking".)

Finally, you right an amazing application and win lots of awards ;)
