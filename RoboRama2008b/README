This is Paul's version of Ed & Eric's FW that drives tankbot & runs on
the VIA board under linux. It's what was used in the fall 2008 Roborama.

How to make the robot 'work'.

You need to test that we can talk to the robto
./estop
(It should report that "the robot is talking".)
If it reports that the robot is not talking, rerun it - the robot
should now talk. If it doesn't, power cycle.

Build the application by typing "make"

Run the application with a command like:
./outnback 0 100 0 0
to drive 100 inches out and 100 inches backward to the start.
