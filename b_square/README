This is the latest version of Ed & Eric's tankbot FW that runs on the VIA
board under linux.

How to make the robot 'work'.

First you need to set up the serial settings
ctty -F /dev/ttyS0 < /root/set3.txt

Second you need to test that we can talk to the robto
/root/tankbot-v3/estop
(It should report that "the robot is talking".)

Finally, you right an amazing application and win lots of awards ;)
